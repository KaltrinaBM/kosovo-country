        <h3>The ancient Illyrians are known as the Albanian predecessors and the initial inhabitants on the Balkan
            Peninsula which were followed by the Slavs in the 6th and 7th centuries. The country of Kosovo was ruled by
            Bulgaria from the 9th century up until the Serbs took control in the 12th century. In 1389, the Ottoman
            Empire Turks defeated the Serbs and absorbed Kosovo. Following the Ottoman Turks defeat, the Ottoman Empire
            ruled centuries until year 1913 which was when Serbia regained control over Kosovo as it became part of the
            Yugoslavia Federation. On February 17, 2008, Kosovo gained its independence from Serbia after another bloody
            war around the end of the 20th century.</h3>

            and has been repainted differently every year, continuously giving it a new meaning. Each year’s theme
